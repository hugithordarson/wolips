<h1>Plug-ins, Features and Fragments</h1>
<p>Recommended reading: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/whitepapers/eclipse-overview.pdf">http://www.Eclipse.org/whitepapers/Eclipse-overview.pdf</a></p>
<p><i>&quot;The Eclipse Platform is built on a mechanism for discovering, integrating, 
  and running modules called plug-ins. A tool provider writes a tool as a separate 
  plug-in that operates on files in the workspace and surfaces its tool-specific 
  UI in the workbench. When the Platform is launched, the user is presented with 
  an integrated development environment (IDE) composed of the set of available 
  plug-ins.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;A plug-in is the smallest unit of Eclipse Platform function that can 
  be developed and delivered separately. Usually a small tool is written as a 
  single plug-in, whereas a complex tool has its functionality split across several 
  plug-ins. Except for a small kernel known as the Platform Runtime, all of the 
  Eclipse Platform's functionality is located in plug-ins.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;The Eclipse Platform's update manager downloads and installs new features 
  or upgraded versions of existing features (a feature being a group of related 
  plug-ins that get installed and updated together). The update manager constructs 
  a new configuration of available plug-ins to be used the next time the Eclipse 
  Platform is launched. If the result of upgrading or installing proves unsatisfactory, 
  the user can roll back to an earlier configuration. &quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Plug-ins are coded in Java. A typical plug-in consists of Java code 
  in a JAR library, some read-only files, and other resources such as images, 
  web templates, message catalogs, native code libraries, etc. Some plug-ins do 
  not contain code at all. One such example is a plug-in that contributes online 
  help in the form of HTML pages. A single plug-in's code libraries and read-only 
  content are located together in a directory in the file system, or at a base 
  URL on a server. There is also a mechanism that permits a plug-in to be synthesized 
  from several separate fragments, each in their own directory or URL. This is 
  the mechanism used to deliver separate language packs for an internationalized 
  plug-in.&quot;</i></p>
<h2>Features &gt;&gt; Plug-ins &gt;&gt; Fragments</h2>
<p>Plug-ins provide functionality to Eclipse. Their code and other contents may 
  be organised in fragments. Fragments are very much like plug-ins (they reside 
  in the plugins folder). The only difference is that by definition a fragment 
  is a part of a plug-in. Plug-ins (and fragments) are grouped and managed as 
  features. Features do not contribute functionality. It is possible, but not 
  recommended, to skip installing the features.</p>
<h2></h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.feature</b> - This feature manages all the plug-ins 
    that constitutes WOLips except for the profiling and tests plug-ins. Those 
    two plug-ins are managed by separate features. If you do not install all the 
    plug-ins managed by this feature WOLips will not function properly. 
    <ul>
      <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips</b> - The core. 
        <ul>
          <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.devstudio</b> - Support for the devstudio 
            from project</li>
          <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.help</b> - Help</li>
          <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.launching</b> - Launch WOApplications.</li>
          <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.projectbuild</b> - </li>
          <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.source</b> - The sourcecode and javadoc.</li>
          <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.support</b> - Support console.</li>
          <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.ui</b> - </li>
          <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.wizards</b> - </li>
          <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.wounit</b> - Unit testing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.ant</b> - </li>
      <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.cayenne</b> - </li>
      <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.cayenne.ant</b> - </li>
      <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.cayenne.woproject</b> - </li>
      <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.cayenne.woproject.ant</b> - </li>
      <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.targetbuilder</b> - JavaClient support.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.profiling.feature</b> - This feature manages the 
    profiling plug-in only. If you don't have jMechanic (and WOLips) installed, 
    this plug-in does nothing - no need to install it in that case. 
    <ul>
      <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.profiling</b> - Profile WOApplications.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.tests.feature</b> - This feature manages the tests 
    plug-in only. It will allow you to run WOLips unit tests. When/if you file 
    a bug report the WOLips developers may ask you to run these. You do not need 
    this plug-in &quot;use&quot; WOLips. 
    <ul>
      <li><b>org.objectstyle.wolips.tests</b> -</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
