<h1>Refactoring with WOLips </h1>
<p>Eclipse has great built-in support for refactoring. For WO these are not enough... 
</p>
<h2>Move and/or Rename Enterprise Objects</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Move/Rename the java file with the Eclipse built-in Java refactoring functionality.</li>
  <li>(You have to know the name of the entity linked to this class.) Open EOModeler 
    and set the entity's class to be the new fully qualified class name (or edit 
    the entity's *.plist to do the same thing).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Move Components</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Move the java file with the Eclipse built-in Java refactoring functionality.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the component used to be in the default (no) package and its accessor mothods 
  are protected, you have a problem. This problem has a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/webobjects/Reference/API/com/webobjects/foundation/NSKeyValueCoding.ValueAccessor.html">solution</a>. 
</p>
<p>WOBuilder likes to add (sub) components with their fully qualified names. This 
  is not necessary. Using just the class name works fine.</p>
<h2>Rename Components</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Rename the java file with the Eclipse built-in Java refactoring functionality.</li>
  <li>Rename the components other files: *.api, *.html, *.wod &amp; *.woo</li>
  <li>Find all instances of the old name in *.wod files and replace it with the 
    new name.</li>
</ol>
