<h1>Release Plan</h1>
<p>WOLips development is driven by bug reports and feature requests posted at our bugtracker  
  <a href="http://objectstyle.org/jira/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10001">Jira</a>. Bugs 
  that are not reported won't get fixed, and features that aren't requested will 
  not materialise.</p>
<p> WOLips is a collaborative open source effort. Please consider contributing!</p>
<p>There are three kinds of relases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Equivalent: 1.2.3 -&gt; 1.2.4 with no new features, only bug fixes.</li>
  <li>Compatible: 1.2.3 -&gt; 1.3.0 with new features, and possibly some bugs 
    fixed.</li>
  <li>Major: 1.2.3 to 2.0.0 with major additions and/or modifications. Not necessarily 
    compatible with or equivalent to previous versions</li>
</ol>
<p>Tracker items (bug reports and feature requests) have a Status, a Category 
  and a Group. The Group indicates which release will address the item, and the 
  Category which part of WOProject it concerns. The Status can be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open: Just submitted and/or not yet completed.</li>
  <li>Closed: </li>
  <li>Deleted:</li>
  <li>Pending: Waiting for reply from the original author.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get an idea about when a specific bug will be fixed or a specific feature 
  added look at the tracker item Group:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Equivalent: Next Equivalent Release</li>
  <li>Compatible: Next Compatible Release</li>
  <li>Major: Next Major Release</li>
  <li>?: Not Assigned</li>
</ul>
<p>Planned next releases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Equivalent: May 2003</li>
  <li>Compatible: June 2003</li>
  <li>Major: January 2004</li>
</ul>
