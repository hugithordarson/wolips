<h1>Defining classpaths</h1>
<h2><a href="../images/pref/proj_path.jpg"><img src="../images/pref/proj_path.jpg" height="300" align="right" border="0"></a>Project's 
  Java Build Path</h2>
<p>There are 3 kinds of items you can add to a project's Java Build Path:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Source - from this project</li>
  <li>Projects - other Eclipse projects currently being developed</li>
  <li>Libraries - compiled code</li>
</ul>
<p>When you add a project, you actually add everything that project is defined 
  to export - which may be more than just the source. A project can export anything 
  that is included in its own Java Build Path.</p>
<p>Libraries come in various forms, and there are several ways to add them. Installed 
  (External Root, User Home, Local or System) WebObjects frameworks can be added
   with the WO Frameworks Classpath Container:</p>

  Java Build Path</h2>
<p>What you should know about the WO Frameworks Classpath Container:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Container preserves only the Framework name. Due to this it can resolve
   a framework path as long as it is installed under one of the supported roots.</li>
  <li>The search order for frameworks is: External Root, User Home, Local and System.
  If a framework is installed in the User Home and Local the one from the User Home is used.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="../images/launch/classpath.jpg"><img src="../images/launch/classpath.jpg" height="300" align="right" border="0"></a>Launch 
  Configuration's Classpath</h2>
<p>If you defined your projects' Java Build Paths as recommended above you can 
  leave the launch configurations' Classpaths the at the default. For launching 
  to work the classpath must contain the built frameworks. Linking to (framework) 
  projects is not enough! If you set the Java Build Path as above you have both 
  the projects and the built frameworks on the classpath - this ok. If you want 
  to remove the projects from the classpath, that's ok too.</p>
