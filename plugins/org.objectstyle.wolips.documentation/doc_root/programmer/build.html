<h1>Building WOLips from source</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Install <a href="http://ant.apache.org/index.html">Ant</a> on your system. 
    (Make sure the installation is correct and working properly before continuing!) 
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=50507">Download the latest 
    WOProject source from SourceForge</a>. You may use Eclipse as a CVS client, and  should in that case use the woproject/projects directory as your project root. WOLips versions compatible with eclipse 2.x.x are in HEAD and for eclipse 3.x.x you should use the eclipse_3_0_0 branch.</li>
  <li>Change to the woproject/projects root directory. (If you want to build from within eclipse you have to set a classpath variable ANT_HOME.) </li>
  <li>Create a build.properties file with a property eclipse.home that points to where you installed eclipse.</li>
  <li>Execute ant (dist is the default target in build.xml, and that's what you 
  want).</li>
  <li>You'll find the result in the ./temp directory.</li>
  <li>Install WOLips by pointing the eclipse update manager to ./temp/dist/site.xml </li>
</ol>
